What you learnt outside the class?
Be specific...

Week1:-
      *In first week after the class, I discussed that this Prof.(sir) is very interesting person with my friends.
       So, definitely this subjest will be our strongest subject in semester-v.
      *After long time, we got a friendly Prof. so it is a good thing for us.
      *I did not start programming till this week, but in future I have to do this at any cost.
      
Week2:-
      *In the first week I was tension free, because there was not any type of project for us till this week.
      *When this week started, problemes also started as usual. So I tried to fight with this types of problems.
      *Sir told us that in this position we did not have any excuse for any things.
      
Week3:-
      *In this week, I was facing a big problem, which type of project should I select.
       That project should not be present in the market.
      *So we  choosed many types of projects in veryous field. But, When we search in the Internet 
       or discussed amoung the friends. We found that, this type of project already exist.
      *After more confusion and problems, I got two things for this subject. One is group-project 
       and other one is individual project.
      *
